      <span class="text">Our little town opened a children's museum (pre-pandemic) which my husband helped design.  This is a picture of Ceili participating in a fund-raiser for the museum; children get to paint their handprints on the wall; the whole family still has handprints on the wall today.  This picture happened to be taken on her birthday. </span></div>
